# django-twilio-access-token
This is a Django application that can be used to generate Twilio access token for particular services, such as Voice, Chat, and Video.

## Prerequisite
### Twilio
We use Twilio client for [python](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python#install-the-library) to generate an access token for particular services. So to make it works, you need to install Twilio client either through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) command,

```
pip install twilio
```

or put it directly on your `requirements.txt`

```
twilio~=6.32.0
```
